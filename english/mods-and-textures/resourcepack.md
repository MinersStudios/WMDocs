    * Translation for user interface
2.  ### **Lite**

    This version is for players who prefer a more classic look for the game, not wanting to include decorative additions that **do not affect** _custom blocks_, _items_ and _decorations_. It **does not include** the following items :

## Installation

When you log in to our server, you have two options to choose the version of the resourcepack, as well as the option to install manually. We strive to make this process as convenient as possible for players.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you manually install, you lose the automatic resource updates

To avoid unnecessary problems, check the repository regularly for fresh updates, or follow the updates in the _«Updates»_ channel on our [Discord server](https://discord.whomine.net)
{% endhint %}

1.  ## Automatic installation

    \
    When you first go to the server you will see a window to select the desired version of the resourcepack, where three options will be offered :

    * Full Version
    * Without resourcepack _(Manual installation)_
    * Lite Version

2.  ## Manual installation

    If you select the _«Without resourcepack»_ version, you will need to install it manually. To do this, follow the steps below :

    * Download the latest version of the resourcepack you need from the [official repository](https://whomine.net/textures)
    * Move the archive with the resourcepack to the folder `.minecraft/resourcepacks`

## Overall contribution

{% hint style="info" %}
Each of the **#WhoMine** players can create their own unique model or texture and submit a request to add it to the server's shared resourcepack
{% endhint %}

We value the input of our players and are willing to consider your own textures and models

If you have ideas or improvements you would like to make to the resourcepack, you can submit them to the server administration. We will consider your suggestions and, if they match our style and quality, add them to the resourcepack in future updates
