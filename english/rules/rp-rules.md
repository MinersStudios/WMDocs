# RP Rules

***

## &#x20;`1`  RP deaths and wagering

1. Try to negotiate the rp of killing a person outside of the event specifically with that person, as well as, come to a mutual agreement
2. _Rp war_ mode - if two factions have ruined rp relations with each other - they can negotiate terms and go to _war mode_ by mutual consent. In war mode both factions can kill each other at any time with the help of pvp rp kills _(by beating each other to death with a sword)_ and can do other things to each other that are included in the mutual consent between the parties

***

## &#x20;`2`  RP signs

1. **RP sign** - a sign that contains a description of a specific location, object, block, or environment. RP signs should not be placed _"for fun."_ If you come across a humorous sign that does not serve RP purposes, please report it to the administration, but do not break it yourself
2. **RP sign** should adhere to the following standards :
   * The text must be legible and contrasting
   * The inscription on the sign should be enclosed in square brackets - \[ ]

## &#x20;`3`  Motive

1. If your character lacks a clear _motive_ for certain actions that affect other players _(such as killings, wars, etc.)_ or if the motive is insufficient for such actions, then when appealing to **non-RP á Œcourts**, you may be required to cease specific _RP_ _actions_, lose an _RP relationship branch_ with a particular character, receive an _RP character or event rollback_, and in exceptional cases, **receive a ban**
